The PHQ-9 is a self-administered questionnaire based on the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD).

The total score ranges between 0 to 27. To calculate total score: When one or two items were missing, the total-score was calculated as 9 × (total points/ (9−number of missing items)) and rounded to the nearest integer.
